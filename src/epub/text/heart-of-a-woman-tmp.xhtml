			<p>
v#The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
v#As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
v#Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam
v#In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.
		</p>
		<p>
v#The heart of a woman falls back with the night,
v#And enters some alien cage in its plight,
v#And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
v#While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.

v#Smiles do not always echo cheer, 
v##Nor tear-drops measure grief, 
v#For sorrow seeks a gilded mask, 
v##And joy in tears, relief.

v#When life is young, without a care, 
v##Alone we walk, and free: 
v#The world, a splendid merry round 
v##Of rhythmic melody.
</p>

<p>
v#Before the end, grim sorrow calls 
v##Into each mortal ear,
v#When friendship fades to memories, 
v##And love lies in its bier.
</p>

<p>
v#Then, then it is that sympathy 
v##Is holden close and dear; 
v#Ah, then life's consolation comes 
v##Commingled with a tear.

<p>
v#O love, you have shorn me, and rifled my heart, 
v#You have torn down the shrine from the innermost part,
v#And through it now rushes a grief, sadly-wild, 
v#That breaks as the plaint of a sorrowing child.

v#All deep there stirs the throb of Spring, 
v#Its vital pulse I'm answering, 
v#Swift to its dominant I merge, 
v#One with its undulating surge; 
v#My heart awakes to virile tone 
v#And breaks—unanswered, and alone.

v#The shades of the gloaming around me are stealing,
v##The lure of the dusk through the silences call, 
v#While blossoming incense comes mutely appealing,
v##And choiring wood-voices, vespering, fall. 
v#Immersed in the deep of my dim sylvan-bower, 
v##Upborne on the breast of its emerald tide, 
v#I drift with the gleam of the vanishing hour 
v##Afar—where my uttermost longings abide.

v#I have swung to the uttermost reaches of pain,

v#Again we meet—a flashing glance,

v#While thoughts troop on in cavalcade 
v#Adown the wide aisles time has made.

<p>
v#Back in the glow of yesterday, 
v#With tender troth you rode away, 
v#The sheen of rainbows in our eyes,

v#And now a writhing worm am I, 
v#Beneath a doomed love's lensing eye,

		The Heart of a Woman<br/>
		<br/>
		The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,<br/>
		As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,<br/>
		Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam<br/>
		In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.<br/>
		 <br/>
		The heart of a woman falls back with the night,<br/>
		And enters some alien cage in its plight,<br/>
		And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars<br/>
		While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Gossamer<br/>
		<br/>
		The dreams of the dreamer<br/>
		Are life-drops that pass<br/>
		 <br/>
		The break in the heart<br/>
		To the soul’s hour-glass.<br/>
		 <br/>
		The songs of the singer<br/>
		Are tones that repeat<br/>
		 <br/>
		The cry of the heart<br/>
		'Till it ceases to beat.<br/>
		<br/>
		The Dreams of the Dreamer<br/>
		The dreams of the dreamer<br/>
		   Are life-drops that pass<br/>
		 <br/>
		The break in the heart<br/>
		   To the soul’s hour-glass.<br/>
		 <br/>
		The songs of the singer<br/>
		   Are tones that repeat<br/>
		 <br/>
		The cry of the heart<br/>
		   'Till it ceases to beat.<br/>
		<br/>
		   <br/>
		Sympathy<br/>
		<br/>
		My joy leaps with your ecstasy,<br/>
		   In sympathy divine;<br/>
		The smiles that wreathe upon your lips.<br/>
		   Find sentinels on mine:<br/>
		 <br/>
		Your lightest sigh I'm echoing,<br/>
		   I tremble with your pain,<br/>
		And all your tears are falling<br/>
		   In my heart like bitter rain.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Contemplation<br/>
		<br/>
		We stand mute!<br/>
		No words can paint such fragile imagery,<br/>
		Those prismic gossamers that roll<br/>
		Beyond the sky-line of the soul;<br/>
		We stand mute!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Dead Leaves<br/>
		<br/>
		The breaking dead leaves 'neath my feet<br/>
		A plaintive melody repeat,<br/>
		Recalling shattered hopes that lie<br/>
		As relics of a bygone sky.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Again I thread the mazy past,<br/>
		Back where the mounds are scattered fast -<br/>
		Oh! foolish tears, why do you start,<br/>
		To break of dead leaves in the heart?<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Dawn<br/>
		<br/>
		Trailing night's sand-sifted stars,<br/>
		Rainbows sweep, as day unbars.<br/>
		Fragrant essences of morn,<br/>
		Bathe humanity — new-born!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Elevation<br/>
		<br/>
		There are highways in the soul,<br/>
		   Heights like pyramids that rise<br/>
		   Far beyond earth-veiled eyes,<br/>
		   Sweeping through the barless skies<br/>
		O'er the line where daylight dies —<br/>
		There are highways in the soul!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Whither?<br/>
		<br/>
		Minutes swiftly throb and pass,<br/>
		   Shadows cross the dial-glass,<br/>
		Speeding ever to some call,<br/>
		   Weary world and shadows, all.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Down the closing aisles of day,<br/>
		   Tramping footsteps die away,<br/>
		But no tidings thread the gloom,<br/>
		   From the hushed and silent tomb.<br/>
		   <br/>
		   <br/>
		Quest<br/>
		<br/>
		The phantom happiness I sought<br/>
		   O'er every crag and moor;<br/>
		 <br/>
		I paused at every postern gate,<br/>
		   And knocked at every door;<br/>
		 <br/>
		In vain I searched the land and sea,<br/>
		   E'en to the inmost core,<br/>
		 <br/>
		The curtains of eternal night<br/>
		   Descend — my search is o'er.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Mate<br/>
		<br/>
		Our separate winding ways we trod,<br/>
		Along the highways, unto God,<br/>
		Unbonded by the clasp of hand,<br/>
		Without a vow — we understand.<br/>
		Estranged for aye, the fusing kiss.<br/>
		Omnipotent, we bide in this —<br/>
		They need no trammeling of bars<br/>
		Whose souls were welded with the stars.<br/>
		<br/>
		Emblems<br/>
		<br/>
		A wordless kiss, a stifled sigh,<br/>
		A trembling lip, a downcast eye,<br/>
		   "Alas," they say,<br/>
		   "A-day, a-day,"<br/>
		The cruse has failed, the lamp must die!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Mirrored<br/>
		<br/>
		When lone and solitaire within your chamber,<br/>
		   With lamp unlit, as evening shades unroll.<br/>
		If you reveal the trail your thoughts are taking,<br/>
		   I then may read the riddle of your soul.<br/>
		 <br/>
		For it is then, the tired mind unveiling,<br/>
		   Drifts stark into the holy after-glow.<br/>
		Within the hour of quiet meditation.<br/>
		   The tidal thoughts, like limpid waters, flow.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Pent<br/>
		<br/>
		The rain is falling steadily<br/>
		   Upon the thirsty earth,<br/>
		While dry-eyed, I remain, and calm<br/>
		   Amid my own heart's dearth.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Break! break! ye flood-gates of my tears<br/>
		   All pent in agony,<br/>
		Rain, rain! upon my scorching soul<br/>
		   And flood it as the sea!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Pages from Life<br/>
		<br/>
		Not for your tender eyes that shine,<br/>
		Nor for your red lips pulsing wine,<br/>
		I love you, dear: your soul divine.<br/>
		In sweet captivity, holds mine!<br/>
		. . .<br/>
		The tender eyes have lost their glow,<br/>
		The flagons of the lips run low.<br/>
		The autumn trembles in the air, —<br/>
		A woman passes solitaire!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Recall<br/>
		<br/>
		Winter — aback sweeps the inward eye,<br/>
		Fleet o'er the trail to a rose-wreathed sky,<br/>
		Girt by a cordon of dreams I dwell<br/>
		Deep in the heart of the old-time spell.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Almost, the tones of your whispered word,<br/>
		Almost! the thrill that your dear lips stirred,<br/>
		Almost!! that wild pulsing throb again —<br/>
		Almost!!! —<br/>
		      ('Tis winter, the falling rain).<br/>
		      <br/>
		      <br/>
		Foredoom<br/>
		<br/>
		Her life was dwarfed, and wed to blight,<br/>
		Her very days were shades of night,<br/>
		Her every dream was born entombed.<br/>
		Her soul, a bud, — that never bloomed.<br/>
		<br/>
		Peace<br/>
		<br/>
		I rest me deep within the wood,<br/>
		   Drawn by its silent call,<br/>
		Far from the throbbing crowd of men<br/>
		   On nature's breast I fall.<br/>
		 <br/>
		My couch is sweet with blossoms fair,<br/>
		   A bed of fragrant dreams,<br/>
		And soft upon my ear there falls<br/>
		   The lullaby of streams.<br/>
		 <br/>
		The tumult of my heart is stilled,<br/>
		   Within this sheltered spot.<br/>
		Deep in the bosom of the wood.<br/>
		   Forgetting, and — forgot!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Despair<br/>
		<br/>
		The curtains of twilight are drawn in the west<br/>
		   And vespers are sweet on the air,<br/>
		While I, through my leafless, ungarlanded way<br/>
		   But pause at the gates of despair.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Good-bye to the hopes that were never fulfilled,<br/>
		   Good-bye to the fond dreams that failed.<br/>
		Good-bye to my dead that has never been born.<br/>
		   Good-bye to love's ship that ne'er sailed.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Eventide<br/>
		<br/>
		The silence of the brooding night,<br/>
		Enfolds me with its eerie light;<br/>
		I lie upon its shadowed breast<br/>
		A pilgrim, wearying for rest<br/>
		 <br/>
		Nightfall! thy sable curtains steep<br/>
		My very soul in solace deep,<br/>
		God sends thee with thy soothing balms,<br/>
		That I may falter to thy arms.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Gethsemane<br/>
		<br/>
		Into the garden of sorrow,<br/>
		Some day we all must roam,<br/>
		If not to-day, then to-morrow,<br/>
		Bow 'neath its purple dome.<br/>
		Out from the musk-laden banqueting halls,<br/>
		Doffing our mirth-spangled vestments like thralls,<br/>
		Softly we wend to Gethsemane,<br/>
		In the hour that sorrow calls!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Gilead<br/>
		<br/>
		Walk within thy own heart's temple, child, and rest,<br/>
		What you seek abides forever in thy breast.<br/>
		Closer than thy folded arm<br/>
		Is the soul-renewing-balm,<br/>
		Walk within thy own heart's temple, child, and rest.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Impelled<br/>
		<br/>
		Athwart the sky the great sun sails,<br/>
		Through aeons thus, the daylight trails,<br/>
		And man, living breath of the sod<br/>
		Beholding, in his heart knows God.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Throughout the night's long brooding deep,<br/>
		Earth's trustful children die-to-sleep.<br/>
		But with the whisperings of morn<br/>
		Awake, unto the day, new-born.<br/>
		 <br/>
		The mystery of earth untold,<br/>
		The great infinite, none behold,<br/>
		Forge ever new the spiral chain,<br/>
		Revolving man to God again.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		In Quest<br/>
		<br/>
		With the first blush of morning, my soul is awing,<br/>
		Away o'er the phantom lands free, wandering,<br/>
		I seek thee in hamlet, in woodland, and hall.<br/>
		Till night-shades, enfolding my tired heart, fall.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Yet ever and alway, like the thrush in a tree.<br/>
		My heart lifts its preluding love-song to thee;<br/>
		I call through the days, through the long weary years.<br/>
		And slumber at night-fall, refreshed by my tears.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Inevitably<br/>
		<br/>
		There's nothing in the world that clings<br/>
		As does a memory that stings;<br/>
		While happy hours fade and pass,<br/>
		Like shadows in a looking-glass.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Isolation<br/>
		<br/>
		Alone! yes, evermore alone — isolate each his way,<br/>
		Though hand is echoing to hand vain sophistries of clay.<br/>
		Within that veilèd, mystic place where bides the inmost soul,<br/>
		No twain shall pass while tides shall wax, nor changing seasons roll.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Enisled, apart our pilgrimage, despite the arms that twine.<br/>
		Despite the fusing kiss that wields the magic charm of wine.<br/>
		Despite the interplay of sigh, the surge of sympathy.<br/>
		We tread in solitude remote, the trail of destiny!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Joy<br/>
		<br/>
		There's a soft rosy glow o’er the whole world to-day,<br/>
		There's a freshness and fragrance that trembles in May,<br/>
		There's a lilt in the music that vibrates and thrills<br/>
		From the uttermost glades to the tops of the hills.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Oh! I am so happy, my heart is so light.<br/>
		The shades and the shadows have vanished from sight,<br/>
		This wild pulsing gladness throbs like a sweet pain —<br/>
		O soul of me, drink, ere night falleth again!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Memory<br/>
		<br/>
		Love's roses I gathered, all dewy, in May,<br/>
		My heart holds the breath of their attar to-day;<br/>
		And now, while the blasts of the winter winds ring,<br/>
		I hear not the tempest, Tm dreaming of Spring.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Modulations<br/>
		<br/>
		The petals of the faded rose<br/>
		   Commingle silently,<br/>
		One with the atoms of the dust,<br/>
		   One with the chaliced sea. -<br/>
		 <br/>
		The essence of my fleeting youth<br/>
		   Caught in the web of time,<br/>
		Exhales within the springing flowers<br/>
		   Or breathes in love sublime.<br/>
		   <br/>
		   <br/>
		Omega<br/>
		<br/>
		The fragile fabric of our dream<br/>
		Drifts as a feather down life's stream<br/>
		The long defile of empty days<br/>
		Grim silhouetted, mock my gaze.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Though oft escapes the stifled sigh,<br/>
		A desert ever broods my eye —<br/>
		Since you have utterly forgot,<br/>
		God grant that I remember not!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Poetry<br/>
		<br/>
		Behold! the living thrilling lines<br/>
		That course the blood like madd'ning wines,<br/>
		And leap with scintillating spray<br/>
		Across the guards of ecstasy.<br/>
		The flame that lights the lurid spell<br/>
		Springs from the soul's artesian well,<br/>
		Its fairy filament of art<br/>
		Entwines the fragments of a heart.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Posthumous<br/>
		<br/>
		Of what avail the tardy showers,<br/>
		To the famished summer flowers?<br/>
		All in vain the rain-drops cry,<br/>
		Dead things never make reply.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Life's belated cup of bliss,<br/>
		Woo the weary lips to kiss,<br/>
		When the singing is a sigh.<br/>
		Pulses quivering, to die.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Query<br/>
		<br/>
		Is she the sage who will not sip<br/>
		The cup love presses to her lip?<br/>
		Or she who drinks the mad cup dry,<br/>
		And turns with smiling face — to die?<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Recompense<br/>
		<br/>
		Roses after rain,<br/>
		Pleasure after pain,<br/>
		Happiness will soothe the sigh,<br/>
		Smiles await the tear-dimmed eye<br/>
		Bloom will follow blight,<br/>
		Daylight trails the night,<br/>
		Life is sweeter<br/>
		Love is deeper<br/>
		In the heart's twilight!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Repulse<br/>
		<br/>
		Nobody cares when I am glad,<br/>
		      I beat upon their hearts in glee,<br/>
		   "Drink, drink joy's brimming cup with me,"<br/>
		   All echoless, my ecstasy —<br/>
		Nobody cares when I am glad.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Nobody cares when I am sad,<br/>
		      Whene'er I seek compassion's breast,<br/>
		   I falter wounded from my quest<br/>
		   Back! back into my heart, sore prest —<br/>
		Nobody cares when I am sad.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Rhythm<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh, my fancy teems with a world of dreams, —<br/>
		   They revolve in a glittering fire,<br/>
		How they twirl and go with the tunes that flow<br/>
		   On the breath of my soul-strung lyre.<br/>
		   <br/>
		   <br/>
		Smothered Fires<br/>
		<br/>
		A woman with a burning flame<br/>
		   Deep covered through the years<br/>
		With ashes. Ah! she hid it deep,<br/>
		   And smothered it with tears.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Sometimes a baleful light would rise<br/>
		   From out the dusky bed,<br/>
		And then the woman hushed it quick<br/>
		   To slumber on, as dead.<br/>
		 <br/>
		At last the weary war was done<br/>
		   The tapers were alight,<br/>
		And with a sigh of victory<br/>
		   She breathed a soft — good-night!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Supreme<br/>
		<br/>
		The fairest lips are those we kiss,<br/>
		With greatest ecstasy and bliss;<br/>
		The brightest eyes, are those that shine,<br/>
		Unchangingly through changing time;<br/>
		The greatest love is that we know.<br/>
		When life is just an afterglow.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Sympathy<br/>
		<br/>
		My joy leaps with your ecstasy,<br/>
		   In sympathy divine;<br/>
		The smiles that wreathe upon your lips.<br/>
		   Find sentinels on mine:<br/>
		 <br/>
		Your lightest sigh I'm echoing,<br/>
		   I tremble with your pain,<br/>
		And all your tears are falling<br/>
		   In my heart like bitter rain.<br/>
		   <br/>
		<br/>
		Tears and Kisses<br/>
		<br/>
		There are tears sweet, refreshing like dewdrops that rise,<br/>
		There are tears far too deep for the lakes of the eyes.<br/>
		 <br/>
		There are kisses like thistledown, fitfully sped,<br/>
		There are kisses that live in the hearts of the dead.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The Measure<br/>
		<br/>
		Fierce is the conflict — the battle of eyes,<br/>
		Sure and unerring, the wordless replies,<br/>
		Challenges flash from their ambushing caves<br/>
		Men, by their glances, are masters or slaves.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Thrall<br/>
		<br/>
		Fragile, tiny, just a sprite,<br/>
		Holding me a thrall bedight,<br/>
		Stronger than a giant's wand<br/>
		Serves the word of your command.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Out from rushing worlds, though low<br/>
		Should you whisper, I would know,<br/>
		And would answer, though the breath<br/>
		Be the gateway unto death.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Tired<br/>
		<br/>
		I’m tired, days and nights to me<br/>
		Drag on in slow monotony,<br/>
		With not a single star in sight<br/>
		To lend a gleam of cheering light.<br/>
		 <br/>
		I'm tired, there are none to care<br/>
		That I am drifting to despair:<br/>
		O shadows! take me to your breast<br/>
		For I am tired — I would rest.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		What Need Have I For Memory?<br/>
		<br/>
		What need have I for memory,<br/>
		   When not a single flower<br/>
		Has bloomed within life's desert<br/>
		   For me, one little hour.<br/>
		 <br/>
		What need have I for memory<br/>
		   Whose burning eyes have met<br/>
		The corse of unborn happiness<br/>
		   Winding the trail regret?<br/>
		   <br/>
		   <br/>
		When I Am Dead<br/>
		<br/>
		When I am dead, withhold, I pray, your blooming legacy;<br/>
		Beneath the willows did I bide, and they should cover me;<br/>
		I longed for light and fragrance, and I sought them far and near,<br/>
		O, it would grieve me utterly, to find them on my bier!<br/>
		<br/>
		  <br/>
		Whene'er I Lift My Eyes to Bliss<br/>
		<br/>
		Whene'er I lift my eyes to bliss,<br/>
		   I stagger blind with pain,<br/>
		Afar into the folding night<br/>
		   The silence, and the rain.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Whene'er I feel the urge of Spring,<br/>
		   A throbbing, unknown woe<br/>
		Enfolds me; I am desolate<br/>
		   When love is calling low.<br/>
		 <br/>
		<br/>
		Where?<br/>
		<br/>
		I called you through the silent night<br/>
		   Across the brooding deep,<br/>
		I sought you in the shadowland<br/>
		   From out the world — asleep;<br/>
		 <br/>
		No answer echoed to my call,<br/>
		   And now my way I thread<br/>
		About the lowly mounds that rise<br/>
		   Among the silent dead.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Though voiceless, you will hear my call,<br/>
		   Your soul will heed my cry.<br/>
		Will rise, and mock the prison where<br/>
		   Your bones recumbent lie.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Youth<br/>
		<br/>
		The dew is on the grasses, dear,<br/>
		The blush is on the rose.<br/>
		And swift across our dial-youth,<br/>
		A shifting shadow goes.<br/>
		 <br/>
		The primrose moments, lush with bliss,<br/>
		Exhale and fade away,<br/>
		Life may renew the Autumn time,<br/>
		But nevermore the May!<br/>

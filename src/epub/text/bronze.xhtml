			<p>
v#And they shall rise and cast their mantles by,
v#Erect and strong and visioned, in the day
v#That rings the knell of Curfew o'er the sway
v#Of prejudice—who reels with mortal cry
v#To lift no more her leprous, blinded eye,
v#Reft of the fetters, far more cursed than they
v#Which held dominion o'er human clay.
v#The spirit soars aloft where rainbows lie.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Like joyful exiles swift returning home—
v#The rhythmic chanson of their eager feet,
v#While voices strange to ecstasy, long dumb,
v#Break forth in major rhapsodies, full sweet.
v#Into the very star-shine, lo! they come
v#Wearing the bays of victory complete!

v#Their gaze uplifting from shoals of despair
v#Like phantoms groping enswathed from the light
v#Up from miasmic depths, children of night,
v#Surge to the piping of Hope's dulcet lay,
v#Souled like the lily, whose splendors declare
v#God's mazèd paradox—purged of all blight,
v#Out from the quagmire, unsullied and fair.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Life holds her arms o'er the festering way,
v#Smiles, as their faith-sandalled rushes prevail,
v#Slowly the sun rides the marge of the day,
v#Wine to the lips sorely anguished and pale;
v#On, ever on, do the serried ranks sway
v#Charging the ultimate, rending the veil.

v#Oh, black man, why do you northward roam, and leave all the farm lands bare?
v#Is your house not warm, tightly thatched from storm, and a larder replete your share?
v#And have you not schools, fit with books and tools the steps of your young to guide?
v#Then what do you seek, in the north cold and bleak, ’mid the whirl of its teeming tide?
		</p>
		<p>
v#I have toiled in your cornfields, and parched in the sun, I have bowed ’neath your load of care,
v#I have patiently garnered your bright golden grain, in season of storm and fair,
v#With a smile I have answered your glowering gloom, while my wounded heart quivering bled,
v#Trailing mute in your wake, as your rosy dawn breaks, while I curtain the mound of my dead.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Though my children are taught in the schools you have wrought, they are blind to the sheen of the sky,
v#For the brand of your hand, casts a pall o’er the land, that enshadows the gleam of the eye,
v#My sons, deftly sapped of the brawn-hood of man, self-rejected and impotent stand,
v#My daughters, unhaloed, unhonored, undone, feed the lust of a dominant land.
		</p>
		<p>
v#I would not remember, yet could not forget, how the hearts beating true to your own,
v#You’ve tortured, and wounded, and filtered their blood ’till a budding Hegira has blown.

		<p>
v#Unstrange is the pathway to Calvary’s hill, which I wend in my dumb agony,
v#Up its perilous height, in the pale morning light, to dissever my own from the tree.
		</p>
		<p>
v#And so I’m away, where the sky-line of day sets the arch of its rainbow afar,<br/>
v#To the land of the north, where the symbol of worth sets the broad gates of combat ajar!<br/>

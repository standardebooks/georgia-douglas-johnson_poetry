		<strong>Sonnet to the Mantled</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		And they shall rise and cast their mantles by,<br/>
		Erect and strong and visioned, in the day<br/>
		That rings the knell of Curfew o'er the sway<br/>
		Of prejudice — who reels with mortal cry<br/>
		To lift no more her leprous, blinded eye.<br/>
		Reft of the fetters, far more cursed than they<br/>
		Which held dominion o'er human clay.<br/>
		The spirit soars aloft where rainbows lie.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Like joyful exiles swift returning home —<br/>
		The rhythmic chanson of their eager feet.<br/>
		While voices strange to ecstasy, long dumb.<br/>
		Break forth in major rhapsodies, full sweet.<br/>
		Into the very star-shine, lo! they come<br/>
		Wearing the bays of victory complete!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Sonnet to Those Who See But Darkly</strong><br/>
		 <br/>
		Their gaze uplifting from shoals of despair<br/>
		Like phantoms groping enswathed from the light<br/>
		Up from miasmic depths, children of night,<br/>
		Surge to the piping of Hope's dulcet lay,<br/>
		Souled like the lily, whose splendors declare<br/>
		God's mazèd paradox — purged of all blight.<br/>
		Out from the quagmire, unsullied and fair.<br/>
		 <br/>
		Life holds her arms o'er the festering way,<br/>
		Smiles, as their faith-sandalled rushes prevail,<br/>
		Slowly the sun rides the marge of the day.<br/>
		Wine to the lips sorely anguished and pale;<br/>
		On, ever on, do the serried ranks sway<br/>
		Charging the ultimate, rending the veil.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Brotherhood</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Come, brothers all!<br/>
		Shall we not wend<br/>
		The blind-way of our prison-world<br/>
		By sympathy entwined?<br/>
		Shall we not make<br/>
		The bleak way for each other's sake<br/>
		Less rugged and unkind?<br/>
		O let each throbbing heart repeat<br/>
		The faint note of another's beat<br/>
		To lift a chanson for the feet<br/>
		That stumble down life's checkered street.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Let Me Not Lose My Dream</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Let me not lose my dream, e’en though I scan the veil<br/>
		with eyes unseeing through their glaze of tears,<br/>
		Let me not falter, though the rungs of fortune perish<br/>
		as I fare above the tumult, praying purer air,<br/>
		Let me not lose the vision, gird me. Powers that toss<br/>
		the worlds, I pray!<br/>
		Hold me, and guard, lest anguish tear my dreams<br/>
		away!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Let Me Not Hate</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Let me not hate, although the bruising world decries my peace,<br/>
		Gives me no quarter, hounds me while I sleep;<br/>
		Would snuff the candles of my soul and sear my inmost dreamings.<br/>
		Let me not hate, though girt by vipers, green and hissing through the dark;<br/>
		I fain must love. God help me keep the altar-gleams that flicker wearily, anon,<br/>
		On down the world’s grim night!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Calling Dreams</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		The right to make my dreams come true<br/>
		I ask, nay, I demand of life,<br/>
		Nor shall fate’s deadly contraband<br/>
		Impede my steps, nor countermand.<br/>
		<br/>
		Too long my heart against the ground<br/>
		Has beat the dusty years around,<br/>
		And now, at length, I rise, I wake!<br/>
		And stride into the morning-break !<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Desire</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Ope! ye everlasting doors, unto my soul’s demand,<br/>
		I would go forward, fare beyond these dusty boulevards,<br/>
		Faint lights and fair allure me all insistently<br/>
		And I must stand within the halls resplendent, of my dreams.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Sorrow Singers</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Hear their viol-voices ringing<br/>
		Down the corridor of years,<br/>
		As they lift their twilight faces<br/>
		Through a mist of falling tears!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>The Cross</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		All day the world’s mad mocking strife,<br/>
		The venomed prick of probing knife,<br/>
		The baleful, subtle leer of scorn<br/>
		That rims the world from morn to morn,<br/>
		While reptile-visions writhe and creep<br/>
		Into the very arms of sleep<br/>
		To quench the fitful burnished gleams:<br/>
		A crucifixion in my dreams!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Prejudice</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		These fell miasmic rings of mist, with ghoulish menace bound,<br/>
		Like noose-horizons tightening my little world around,<br/>
		They still the soaring will to wing, to dance, to speed away.<br/>
		And fling the soul insurgent back into its shell of clay:<br/>
		<br/>
		Beneath incrusted silences, a seething Etna lies.<br/>
		The fire of whose furnaces may sleep — but never dies!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Laocoon</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		This spirit-choking atmosphere<br/>
		With deadly serpent-coil<br/>
		Entwines my soaring-upwardness<br/>
		And chains me to the soil,<br/>
		Where’er I seek with eager stride<br/>
		To gain yon gleaming height,<br/>
		These noisesome fetters coil aloft<br/>
		And snare my buoyant flight.<br/>
		<br/>
		O, why these aspirations bold,<br/>
		These rigours of desire.<br/>
		That surge within so ceaselessly<br/>
		Like living tongues of fire?<br/>
		And why these glowing forms of hope<br/>
		That scintillate and shine,<br/>
		If naught of all that burnished dream<br/>
		Can evermore be mine?<br/>
		It cannot be, fate does not mock,<br/>
		And man’s untoward decree<br/>
		Shall not forever thus confine<br/>
		My life’s entirety,<br/>
		My every fibre fierce rebels<br/>
		Against this servile role,<br/>
		And all my being broods to break<br/>
		This death-grip from my soul!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Moods<br/>
		<br/>
		My heart is pregnant with a great despair<br/>
		With much beholding of my people’s care,<br/>
		‘Mid blinded prejudice and nurtured wrong,<br/>
		Exhaling wantonly the days along:<br/>
		I mark Faith’s fragile craft of cheering light<br/>
		Tossing imperiled on the sea of night,<br/>
		And then, enanguished, comes my heart’s low cry,<br/>
		“God, God! I crave to learn the reason why!”<br/>
		Again, in spirit loftily I soar<br/>
		With winged vision through earth’s outer door.<br/>
		In such an hour, it is mine to see,<br/>
		In frowning fortune smiling destiny!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Hegira<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh, black man, why do you northward roam, and leave<br/>
		all the farm lands bare?<br/>
		Is your house not warm, tightly thatched from storm,<br/>
		and a larder replete your share?<br/>
		And have you not schools, fit with books and tools the<br/>
		steps of your young to guide?<br/>
		Then what do you seek, in the north cold and bleak,<br/>
		‘mid the whirl of its teeming tide?<br/>
		<br/>
		I have toiled in your cornfields, and parched in the sun,<br/>
		I have bowed ‘neath your load of care,<br/>
		I have patiently garnered your bright golden grain, in<br/>
		season of storm and fair.<br/>
		With a smile I have answered your glowering gloom,<br/>
		while my wounded heart quivering bled.<br/>
		Trailing mute in your wake, as your rosy dawn breaks,<br/>
		while I curtain the mound of my dead.<br/>
		<br/>
		Though my children are taught in the schools you have<br/>
		wrought, they are blind to the sheen of the sky,<br/>
		For the brand of your hand, casts a pall o’er the land,<br/>
		that enshadows the gleam of the eye.<br/>
		My sons, deftly sapped of the brawn-hood of man, self-<br/>
		rejected and impotent stand,<br/>
		<br/>
		My daughters, unhaloed, unhonored, undone, feed the<br/>
		lust of a dominant land.<br/>
		<br/>
		I would not remember, yet could not forget, how the<br/>
		hearts beating true to your own.<br/>
		You’ve tortured, and wounded, and filtered their blood<br/>
		‘till a budding Hegira has blown.<br/>
		<br/>
		Unstrange is the pathway to Calvary’s hill, which I<br/>
		wend in my dumb agony,<br/>
		Up its perilous height, in the pale morning light, to<br/>
		dissever my own from the tree.<br/>
		<br/>
		And so I’m away, where the sky-line of day sets the<br/>
		arch of its rainbow afar,<br/>
		To the land of the north, where the symbol of worth<br/>
		sets the broad gates of combat ajar!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The Passing of the Ex-Slave<br/>
		<br/>
		Swift melting into yesterday,<br/>
		The tortured hordes of ebon-clay;<br/>
		No more is heard the plaintive strain,<br/>
		The rhythmic chaunting of their pain.<br/>
		<br/>
		Their mounded bodies dimly rise<br/>
		To fill the gulf of sacrifice,<br/>
		And o’er their silent hearts below<br/>
		The mantled millions softly go.<br/>
		<br/>
		Some few remaining still abide.<br/>
		Gnarled sentinels of time and tide.<br/>
		Now mellowed by a chastened glow<br/>
		Which lighter hearts will never know.<br/>
		<br/>
		Winding into the silent way,<br/>
		Spent with the travail of the day,<br/>
		So royal in their humble might<br/>
		These uncrowned Pilgrims of the Night!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>The Octoroon</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		One drop of midnight in the dawn of life’s pulsating stream<br/>
		Marks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its gleam;<br/>
		Forevermore her step she bends insular, strange, apart —<br/>
		And none can read the riddle of her wildly warring heart.<br/>
		<br/>
		The stormy current of her blood beats like a mighty sea<br/>
		Against the man-wrought iron bars of her captivity.<br/>
		For refuge, succor, peace and rest, she seeks that humble fold<br/>
		Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are purest gold.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Aliens</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		(To You — Everywhere! Dedicated)<br/>
		<br/>
		They seem to smile as others smile, the masquerader’s art<br/>
		Conceals them, while, in verity, they’re eating out their heart.<br/>
		Betwixt the two contending stones of crass humanity<br/>
		They lie, the fretted fabric of a dual dynasty.<br/>
		<br/>
		A single drop, a sable strain debars them from their own,-—<br/>
		The others — fold them furtively, but God! they are alone.<br/>
		Blown by the fickle winds of fate far from the traveled mart<br/>
		To die, when they have quite consumed the morsel of their heart.<br/>
		When man shall lift his lowered eyes to meet the moon of truth,<br/>
		Shall break the shallow shell of pride and wax in ways of ruth,<br/>
		He cannot hate, for love shall reign untrammelled in the soul,<br/>
		While peace shall spread a rainbow o’er the earth from pole to pole.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Concord</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Nor shall I in sorrow repine,<br/>
		But offer a paean of praise<br/>
		To the infinite God of my days<br/>
		Who marshals the pivoting spheres<br/>
		Through the intricate maze of the years,<br/>
		Who loosens the luminous flood<br/>
		That lightens the purlieus of men,<br/>
		I shall not in sorrow repine<br/>
		To break the eternal Amen!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>The Mother</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		The mother soothes her mantled child<br/>
		With incantation sad and wild;<br/>
		A deep compassion brims her eye<br/>
		And stills upon her lips, the sigh.<br/>
		<br/>
		Her thoughts are leaping down the years,<br/>
		O’er branding bars, through seething tears,<br/>
		Her heart is sandaling his feet<br/>
		Adown the world’s corroding street.<br/>
		<br/>
		Then, with a start she dons a smile<br/>
		His tender yearnings to beguile.<br/>
		And only God will ever know<br/>
		The wordless measure of her woe.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Maternity</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Proud?<br/>
		Perhaps— and yet<br/>
		I cannot say with surety<br/>
		That I am happy thus to be<br/>
		Responsible for this young life’s embarking.<br/>
		Is he not thrall to prevalent conditions?<br/>
		Does not the day loom dark apace<br/>
		To weave its cordon of disgrace<br/>
		Around his lifted throat?<br/>
		Is not this mezzotint enough and surfeit<br/>
		For such prescience?<br/>
		Ah, did I dare<br/>
		Recall the pulsing life I gave,<br/>
		And fold him in the kindly grave!<br/>
		<br/>
		Proud?<br/>
		Perhaps — could I but ever so faintly scan<br/>
		The broad horizon of a man<br/>
		Swept fair for his dominion —<br/>
		So hesitant and half-afraid<br/>
		I view this babe of sorrow!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Black Woman</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Don’t knock at my door, little child,<br/>
		I cannot let you in.<br/>
		You know not what a world this is<br/>
		Of cruelty and sin.<br/>
		Wait in the still eternity<br/>
		Until I come to you,<br/>
		The world is cruel, cruel, child,<br/>
		I cannot let you in!<br/>
		<br/>
		Don’t knock at my heart, little one,<br/>
		I cannot bear the pain<br/>
		Of turning deaf-ear to your call<br/>
		Time and time again!<br/>
		You do not know the monster men<br/>
		Inhabiting the earth.<br/>
		Be still, be still, my precious child,<br/>
		I must not give you birth!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>"One of the Least of These, My Little One"</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		The infant eyes look out amazed upon the frowning earth,<br/>
		A stranger, in a land now strange, child of the mantled-birth;<br/>
		Waxing, he wonders more and more; the scowling grows apace;<br/>
		A world, behind its barring doors, reviles his ebon face:<br/>
		Yet from this maelstrom issues forth a God-like entity.<br/>
		That loves a world all loveless, and smiles on Calvary!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Shall I Say, "My Son, You're Branded?"</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Shall I say, “My son, you’re branded in this country’s pageantry,<br/>
		By strange subtleties you’re tethered, and no forum sets you free?”<br/>
		Shall I mark the young lights fading through your soul-enchannelled eye,<br/>
		As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of your sky?<br/>
		Or shall I, with love prophetic, bid you dauntlessly arise.<br/>
		Spurn the handicap that clogs you, taking what the world denies,<br/>
		Bid you storm the sullen fortress wrought by prejudice and wrong<br/>
		With a faith that shall not falter, in your heart and on your tongue!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>My Boy</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		I hear you singing happily,<br/>
		My boy of tarnished mien,<br/>
		Lifting your limpid, trustful gaze<br/>
		In innocence serene.<br/>
		<br/>
		A thousand javelins of pain<br/>
		Assault my heaving breast<br/>
		When I behold the storm of years<br/>
		That beat without your nest.<br/>
		<br/>
		O sing, my lark, your matin song<br/>
		Of joyous rhapsody,<br/>
		Distil the sweetness of the hours<br/>
		In gladsome ecstasy.<br/>
		<br/>
		For time awaits your buoyant flight<br/>
		Across the bar of years.<br/>
		Sing, sing your song, my bonny lark,<br/>
		Before it melts in tears!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Guardianship</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		That dusky child upon your knee<br/>
		Is breath of God’s eternity;<br/>
		Direct his vision to the height —<br/>
		Let naught obscure his royal right.<br/>
		<br/>
		Although the highways to renown<br/>
		Are iron-barred by fortune’s frown,<br/>
		‘Tis his to forge the master-key<br/>
		That wields the locks of destiny!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Utopia</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		God grant you wider vision, clearer skies, my son,<br/>
		With morning’s rosy kisses on your brow;<br/>
		May your wild yearnings know repose,<br/>
		And storm-clouds break to smiles<br/>
		As you sweep on with spreading wings<br/>
		Unto a waiting sunset!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Little Son</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		The very acme of my woe,<br/>
		The pivot of my pride,<br/>
		My consolation, and my hope<br/>
		Deferred, but not denied.<br/>
		The substance of my every dream,<br/>
		The riddle of my plight,<br/>
		The very world epitomized<br/>
		In turmoil and delight.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Benediction</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Go forth, my son,<br/>
		Winged by my heart’s desire!<br/>
		Great reaches, yet unknown,<br/>
		Await<br/>
		For your possession.<br/>
		I may not, if I would.<br/>
		Retrace the way with you,<br/>
		My pilgrimage is through,<br/>
		But life is calling you!<br/>
		Fare high and far, my son,<br/>
		A new day has begun.<br/>
		Thy star-ways must be won!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Credo</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		I believe in the ultimate justice of Fate;<br/>
		That the races of men front the sun in their turn;<br/>
		That each soul holds the title to infinite wealth<br/>
		In fee to the will as it masters itself;<br/>
		That the heart of humanity sounds the same tone<br/>
		In impious jungle, or sky-kneeling fane.<br/>
		I believe that the key to the life-mystery<br/>
		Lies deeper than reason and further than death.<br/>
		I believe that the rhythmical conscience within<br/>
		Is guidance enough for the conduct of men.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Promise</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Through the moil and the gloom they have issued<br/>
		To the steps of the upwinding hill,<br/>
		<br/>
		Where the sweet, dulcet pipes of tomorrow<br/>
		In their preluding rhapsodies trill.<br/>
		<br/>
		With a thud comes a stir in the bosom,<br/>
		As there steals on the sight from afar,<br/>
		<br/>
		Through a break of a cloud’s coiling shadow<br/>
		The gleam of a bright morning star!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>The Suppliant</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Long have I beat with timid hands upon life’s leaden door,<br/>
		Praying the patient, futile prayer my fathers prayed before,<br/>
		Yet I remain without the close, unheeded and unheard,<br/>
		And never to my listening ear is borne the waited word.<br/>
		<br/>
		Soft o’er the threshold of the years there comes this counsel cool:<br/>
		The strong demand, contend, prevail; the beggar is a fool!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Hope</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Frail children of sorrow, dethroned by a hue,<br/>
		The shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through,<br/>
		The world has its motion, all things pass away.<br/>
		No night is omnipotent, there must be day.<br/>
		The oak tarries long in the depth of the seed,<br/>
		But swift is the season of nettle and weed.<br/>
		Abide yet awhile in the mellowing shade.<br/>
		And rise with the hour for which you were made.<br/>
		The cycle of seasons, the tidals of man<br/>
		Revolve in the orb of an infinite plan.<br/>
		We move to the rhythm of ages long done,<br/>
		And each has his hour — to dwell in the sun!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Cosmopolite</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Not wholly this or that,<br/>
		But wrought<br/>
		Of alien bloods am I,<br/>
		A product of the interplay<br/>
		Of traveled hearts.<br/>
		Estranged, yet not estranged, I stand<br/>
		All comprehending;<br/>
		From my estate<br/>
		I view earth’s frail dilemma;<br/>
		Scion of fused strength am I,<br/>
		All understanding,<br/>
		Nor this nor that<br/>
		Contains me.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Fusion</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		How deftly does the gardener blend<br/>
		This rose and that<br/>
		To bud a new creation,<br/>
		More gorgeous and more beautiful<br/>
		Than any parent portion,<br/>
		And so,<br/>
		I trace within my warring blood<br/>
		The tributary sources,<br/>
		They potently commingle<br/>
		And sweep<br/>
		With new-born forces!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Perspective</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Some day<br/>
		I shall be glad that it was mine to be<br/>
		A dark fore-runner of a race burgeoning;<br/>
		I then shall know<br/>
		The secret of life’s Calvary,<br/>
		And bless the thorns<br/>
		That wound me!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>When I Rise Up</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		When I rise above the earth,<br/>
		And look down on the things that fetter me,<br/>
		I beat my wings upon the air.<br/>
		Or tranquil lie,<br/>
		Surge after surge of potent strength<br/>
		Like incense comes to me<br/>
		When I rise up above the earth<br/>
		And look down upon the things that fetter me.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Faith</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		The faint lose faith<br/>
		When in the tomb their all is laid,<br/>
		And there returns<br/>
		No echoing of weal or woe.<br/>
		The strong hope on,<br/>
		They see the clods close over head,<br/>
		The grass grow green.<br/>
		No word is said.<br/>
		And yet —<br/>
		A little world within the world<br/>
		Are we,<br/>
		Daily our hearts’ high yearnings fade,<br/>
		Are buried!<br/>
		New ones are made, —<br/>
		Are crucified!<br/>
		And yet —<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>We Face the Future</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		The hour is big with sooth and sign, with errant men at war,<br/>
		While blood of alien, friend, and foe imbues the land afar,<br/>
		And we, with sable faces pent, move with the vanguard line.<br/>
		Shod with a faith that Springtime keeps, and all the stars opine.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Soldier</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Though I should weep until the judgment,<br/>
		How would it serve —<br/>
		Brave men are fighting, women speed them,<br/>
		‘Tis a day<br/>
		Of crucial conflict!<br/>
		My son, sometimes it seems I’d rather hold<br/>
		You safe beneath my heart<br/>
		Than send you forth!<br/>
		But lo! The sun is red and weaker children go!<br/>
		Though I should weep until the judgment.<br/>
		How would it serve!<br/>
		I’ll close my eyes and smile, O Son of Mine,<br/>
		Your cause is kingly!<br/>
		Step proud and confident, worthy your mother;<br/>
		Be firm and brave, O Son of Mine, be strong.<br/>
		For terror waxeth,<br/>
		Speed swift away.<br/>
		Though I should weep until the judgment . . .<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Homing Braves</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		There’s music in the measured tread<br/>
		Of those returning from the dead<br/>
		Like scattered flowers from a plain<br/>
		So lately crimson, with the slain.<br/>
		<br/>
		No more the sound of shuffled feet<br/>
		Shall mark the poltroon on the street,<br/>
		Nor shifting, sodden, downcast eye<br/>
		Reveal the man afraid to die.<br/>
		<br/>
		They shall have paid full, utterly<br/>
		The price of peace across the sea,<br/>
		When, with uplifted glance, they come<br/>
		To claim a kindly welcome home.<br/>
		<br/>
		Nor shall the old-time daedal sting<br/>
		Of prejudice, their manhood wing.<br/>
		Nor heights, nor depths, nor living streams<br/>
		Stand in the pathway of their dreams!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Taps</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		They are embosomed in the sod,<br/>
		In still and tranquil leisure,<br/>
		Their lives they’ve cast like trifles down,<br/>
		To serve their country’s pleasure.<br/>
		<br/>
		Nor bugle call, nor mother’s voice.<br/>
		Nor moody mob’s unreason,<br/>
		Shall break their solace and repose<br/>
		Through swiftly changing season.<br/>
		<br/>
		O graves of men who lived and died<br/>
		Afar from life’s high pleasures,<br/>
		Fold them in tenderly and warm<br/>
		With manifold fond measures.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Peace</strong><br/>
		<br/>
		Peace on a thousand hills and dales,<br/>
		Peace in the hearts of men<br/>
		While kindliness reclaims the soil<br/>
		Where bitterness has been.<br/>
		<br/>
		The night of strife is drifting past,<br/>
		The storm of shell has ceased.<br/>
		Disrupted is the cordon fell,<br/>
		Sweet charity released.<br/>
		<br/>
		Forth from the shadow, swift we come<br/>
		Wrought in the flame together.<br/>
		All men as one beneath the sun<br/>
		In brotherhood forever.

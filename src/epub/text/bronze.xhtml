			<p>
v#And they shall rise and cast their mantles by,
v#Erect and strong and visioned, in the day
v#That rings the knell of Curfew o'er the sway
v#Of prejudice—who reels with mortal cry
v#To lift no more her leprous, blinded eye,
v#Reft of the fetters, far more cursed than they
v#Which held dominion o'er human clay.
v#The spirit soars aloft where rainbows lie.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Like joyful exiles swift returning home—
v#The rhythmic chanson of their eager feet,
v#While voices strange to ecstasy, long dumb,
v#Break forth in major rhapsodies, full sweet.
v#Into the very star-shine, lo! they come
v#Wearing the bays of victory complete!

v#Their gaze uplifting from shoals of despair
v#Like phantoms groping enswathed from the light
v#Up from miasmic depths, children of night,
v#Surge to the piping of Hope's dulcet lay,
v#Souled like the lily, whose splendors declare
v#God's mazèd paradox—purged of all blight,
v#Out from the quagmire, unsullied and fair.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Life holds her arms o'er the festering way,
v#Smiles, as their faith-sandalled rushes prevail,
v#Slowly the sun rides the marge of the day,
v#Wine to the lips sorely anguished and pale;
v#On, ever on, do the serried ranks sway
v#Charging the ultimate, rending the veil.

v#Oh, black man, why do you northward roam, and leave all the farm lands bare?
v#Is your house not warm, tightly thatched from storm, and a larder replete your share?
v#And have you not schools, fit with books and tools the steps of your young to guide?
v#Then what do you seek, in the north cold and bleak, ’mid the whirl of its teeming tide?
		</p>
		<p>
v#I have toiled in your cornfields, and parched in the sun, I have bowed ’neath your load of care,
v#I have patiently garnered your bright golden grain, in season of storm and fair,
v#With a smile I have answered your glowering gloom, while my wounded heart quivering bled,
v#Trailing mute in your wake, as your rosy dawn breaks, while I curtain the mound of my dead.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Though my children are taught in the schools you have wrought, they are blind to the sheen of the sky,
v#For the brand of your hand, casts a pall o’er the land, that enshadows the gleam of the eye,
v#My sons, deftly sapped of the brawn-hood of man, self-rejected and impotent stand,
v#My daughters, unhaloed, unhonored, undone, feed the lust of a dominant land.
		</p>
		<p>
v#I would not remember, yet could not forget, how the hearts beating true to your own,
v#You’ve tortured, and wounded, and filtered their blood ’till a budding Hegira has blown.

		<p>
v#Unstrange is the pathway to Calvary’s hill, which I wend in my dumb agony,
v#Up its perilous height, in the pale morning light, to dissever my own from the tree.
		</p>
		<p>
v#And so I’m away, where the sky-line of day sets the arch of its rainbow afar,<br/>
v#To the land of the north, where the symbol of worth sets the broad gates of combat ajar!<br/>

v#Your cause is kingly!
v#Step proud and confident, worthy your mother;
v#Be firm and brave, O Son of Mine, be strong,
v#For terror waxeth,
v#Speed swift away,
v#Though I should weep until the judgment . . .

v#There’s music in the measured tread
v#Of those returning from the dead
v#Like scattered flowers from a plain
v#So lately crimson, with the slain.
		</p>
		<p>
v#No more the sound of shuffled feet
v#Shall mark the poltroon on the street,
v#Nor shifting, sodden, downcast eye
v#Reveal the man afraid to die.
		</p>
		<p>
v#They shall have paid full, utterly
v#The price of peace across the sea,
v#When, with uplifted glance, they come
v#To claim a kindly welcome home.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Nor shall the old-time daedal sting
v#Of prejudice, their manhood wing,
v#Nor heights, nor depths, nor living streams
v#Stand in the pathway of their dreams!

v#They are embosomed in the sod,
v##In still and tranquil leisure,
v#Their lives they’ve cast like trifles down,
v##To serve their country’s pleasure.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Nor bugle call, nor mother’s voice,
v##Nor moody mob’s unreason,
v#Shall break their solace and repose
v##Through swiftly changing season.
		</p>
		<p>
v#O graves of men who lived and died
v##Afar from life’s high pleasures,
v#Fold them in tenderly and warm
v##With manifold fond measures.

			<p>
v#Peace on a thousand hills and dales,
v#Peace in the hearts of men
v#While kindliness reclaims the soil
v#Where bitterness has been.
</p>
<p>
v#The night of strife is drifting past,
v#The storm of shell has ceased,
v#Disrupted is the cordon fell,
v#Sweet charity released.
</p>
<p>
v#Forth from the shadow, swift we come
v#Wrought in the flame together,
v#All men as one beneath the sun
v#In brotherhood forever.

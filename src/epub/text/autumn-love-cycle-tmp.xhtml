		I Closed My Shutters Fast Last Night<br/>
		<br/>
		I closed my shutters fast last night,<br/>
		Reluctantly and slow,<br/>
		So pleading was the purple sky<br/>
		With all the lights hung low;<br/>
		I left my lagging heart outside<br/>
		Within the dark alone,<br/>
		I heard it singing through the gloom<br/>
		A wordless, anguished tone.<br/>
		Upon my sleepless couch I lay<br/>
		Until the tranquil morn<br/>
		Came through the silver silences<br/>
		To bring my heart forlorn,<br/>
		Restoring it with calm caress<br/>
		Unto its sheltered bower,<br/>
		While whispering: “Await, wait<br/>
		Your golden, perfect hour.”<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Footsteps<br/>
		<br/>
		Passing ever, early, late,<br/>
		No fond footsteps seek my gate,<br/>
		But down the winding road they wend<br/>
		To some other journey’s end.<br/>
		<br/>
		Yet,--I would not have them wait<br/>
		Here within my guarded gate,<br/>
		Certain footsteps I shall know,<br/>
		And for them I listen low!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh Night of Love<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh night of love, your rapt ecstatic hours<br/>
		Were mine, the languor of their pale perfume<br/>
		Pervades me, kisses in a fountain-fire,<br/>
		Surround me,--fetter and consume.<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh night of love, your groves of strange content<br/>
		Project a thralldom over comind days;<br/>
		Exalted, derelict, and blind I went<br/>
		Unmindfully along Life’s misty ways.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Autumn<br/>
		<br/>
		Believe me–when I say<br/>
		That love like yours, at this belated hour,<br/>
		Overwhelms me,--<br/>
		Stills the fount of thought!<br/>
		I move as one new-born–<br/>
		And strange to swift transitions<br/>
		As from my prison door<br/>
		I gaze<br/>
		Into a blinding sunlight!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Thralldom<br/>
		<br/>
		Your voice keeps ringing down the day<br/>
		   In accents soft and mild,<br/>
		   With which you have beguiled<br/>
		   And wooed me as a child.<br/>
		<br/>
		Your presence bounds my every way<br/>
		   And thrills me in its fold<br/>
		   With phantom hands that hold<br/>
		   Like cherished chains of gold.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Separation<br/>
		<br/>
		Within your pulsing day<br/>
		There must be little space<br/>
		For visions of my face<br/>
		To lure your thoughts away.<br/>
		<br/>
		Yet, I would have it so,<br/>
		To be alone the pain<br/>
		That saddens love’s refrain.<br/>
		Pray God you never know!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Proving<br/>
		<br/>
		Were you a leper bathed in wounds<br/>
		   And by the world denied,<br/>
		I’d share your fatal exile<br/>
		   As a privilege, with pride.<br/>
		<br/>
		You are the very sun, the moon,<br/>
		   The starlight of my soul,<br/>
		The sounding motif of my heart<br/>
		   Its impetus and goal!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Interim<br/>
		<br/>
		The days lie dark between our jeweled meetings<br/>
		Like wintry burials.<br/>
		<br/>
		My heart bows low before the cheerless hearth<br/>
		Until your voice rings through the gloom<br/>
		And bids me<br/>
		Wake!<br/>
		And live!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Good-Bye<br/>
		<br/>
		Let’s say ‘Good-bye’<br/>
		Nor wait Love’s latest breath<br/>
		Poised now so lightly on the wing of Death,<br/>
		While yet within our eye one fervent gleam<br/>
		Remains to hallow this, a passing dream:<br/>
		Yes, yes ‘Good-bye,’<br/>
		For it is best to part<br/>
		While Love’s low light still burns<br/>
		Within the heart!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Love's Miracle<br/>
		<br/>
		So like a boundless, soundless sea<br/>
		The miracle of love to me<br/>
		With all the world a rosy dream<br/>
		Sailing upon a silver stream,<br/>
		While I, a fairy in mid-air,<br/>
		Am dancing, dancing everywhere.<br/>
		<br/>
		Hark! do you hear the thunder peal?<br/>
		I care not what it would reveal,<br/>
		Tomorrow will be yesterday<br/>
		When I am shivering and gray:<br/>
		<br/>
		I will not heed the prompter's ring<br/>
		Let others answer, I shall sing<br/>
		And dance the merrier--away!<br/>
		I'll live and live and live--today!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		A Paradox<br/>
		<br/>
		I know you love me better cold<br/>
		Strange as the pyramids of old<br/>
		Responselessly.<br/>
		but I am frail, and spent and weak<br/>
		With surging torrents that bespeak<br/>
		A living fire.<br/>
		So, like a veil, my poor disguise<br/>
		Is draped to save me from your eyes'<br/>
		Deep challenges.<br/>
		Fain would I fling this robe aside<br/>
		And from you, in your bosom hide<br/>
		Eternally.<br/>
		Alas! you love me better cold<br/>
		Like frozen pyramids of old<br/>
		Unyieldingly?<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		How My Heart Sinks<br/>
		<br/>
		How my heart sinks when I behold the sad reflection of my face,<br/>
		A wan and wistful wound, wiht o, such meagre grace;<br/>
		How can you hold me dear withal and conjure charms withdrawn.<br/>
		Or does the Autumn twilight hold a charm unknown to dawn?<br/>
		<br/>
		Hold! Do not speak! some day perchance, I'll read the message dire<br/>
		Within the ashes of the flame, the aftermath of fire,<br/>
		Ere then perhaps I shall have found the highways of the soul<br/>
		Where one may read uncrucified, the blood-words of the scroll.<br/>
		Till then, uphold illusion's veil before my gaze the while<br/>
		That I may gather strength to fuse from agony, a smile!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		To Time<br/>
		<br/>
		Day by day the threads of white<br/>
		Muliply, Oh! hour-glass!<br/>
		How passing swift your bright sands pass,<br/>
		Fain would I hold you,<br/>
		Linger, bide<br/>
		Until these surges shall subside,<br/>
		That sweep me forward unto bliss,<br/>
		Oh! charging sun, I bid you rest,<br/>
		Break not your arrow in my breast!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Welt<br/>
		<br/>
		Would I might mend the fabric of my youth<br/>
		Which daily flaunts its tatters to my eyes,<br/>
		Would I might compromise awhile with truth<br/>
		Until love's moon, now waxing, wanes and dies.<br/>
		<br/>
		For I would go a further while with you<br/>
		And draing this Cup of Joy so passing fair,<br/>
		Which meets my parching lips like cooling dew<br/>
		'Ere time has brush cold fingers through my hair.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Review<br/>
		<br/>
		I fear my power impotent<br/>
		To hold you leal and full content,<br/>
		Some hapless look or word perchance<br/>
		Dispels the glamor of romance;<br/>
		I tremble lest some stranger fair<br/>
		Arrest you,--cause you to compare<br/>
		The meagre charms which I possess<br/>
		With some resplendent loveliness.<br/>
		<br/>
		How far removed from Youth's command<br/>
		The trembling sceptre in my hand,<br/>
		As miserly within the glass<br/>
		I mark Love's fleeting hours pass.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Illusion<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh! for the veils of my far-away youth,<br/>
		Shielding my heart from the blaze of the truth;<br/>
		Why did I stray from their foldings and grow<br/>
		Into the sadness that follows--to know.<br/>
		<br/>
		Impotent atom with desolate gaze<br/>
		Treading Life's treacherous, intricate maze--<br/>
		Oh for the veils, for the vails of my youth<br/>
		Shielding my heart from the blaze of the truth!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Parody<br/>
		<br/>
		You came,<br/>
		The tapestries of love<br/>
		Were shining in the sun,<br/>
		My wishes settled down content<br/>
		About you as you stood.<br/>
		I looked into your cryptic eyes<br/>
		And thought I understood;<br/>
		But no,--<br/>
		The splendor of your gaudy robe<br/>
		Grew dimmer day by day,<br/>
		I wondered,<br/>
		Searched within my soul to seize the mystery.<br/>
		The answer staggered me,<br/>
		Aghast,<br/>
		Like one at bay,<br/>
		I gazed with open eyes of thought upon you,<br/>
		God! 'twas true--<br/>
		A mockery, a parody,<br/>
		Had come to me--in you!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Delusion<br/>
		<br/>
		You gave me your hand,<br/>
		I held it to be<br/>
		The last word, the dear word,<br/>
		The soul's entity;<br/>
		I cherished it, treasured it,<br/>
		Only to find<br/>
		I held but a gauntlet--<br/>
		That I had been blind!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Sunset<br/>
		<br/>
		And now--<br/>
		As one who closes up the house and goes uncaring where<br/>
		He may forget the scenes of home 'mid foreign climes and air,<br/>
		I bar the chamber of my heart and seal the past within<br/>
		To wander down the city's road amid the whirr and din.<br/>
		The long years seem impassable, the morning has no smile,<br/>
		With naught behind these barring doors and nothing else worth while,<br/>
		Like some lone pilgrim without hope, I stumble on my way,<br/>
		Who lifts no futile plea for  sun, but asks for clouds less grey.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Finis<br/>
		<br/>
		I looked death calmly in the face<br/>
		And placed my hand within his hand<br/>
		And said:<br/>
		"Come, come, let us away<br/>
		For I have lost the magic key<br/>
		Opening the portals of desire---<br/>
		My wishes cumber in the dust,<br/>
		And life is stagnant<br/>
		         in<br/>
		                  my<br/>
		                            heart!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		CONTEMPLATION<br/>
		<br/>
		Ivy<br/>
		<br/>
		I am a woman<br/>
		Which means<br/>
		I am insufficient<br/>
		I need---<br/>
		something to hold me<br/>
		Or perhaps uphold.<br/>
		I am a woman.<br/>
		<br/>
		Joy<br/>
		<br/>
		There's nothing certain, nothing sure<br/>
		Save sorrow. Fragile happiness<br/>
		Was never fashioned to endure;<br/>
		For joy repels the perfect claim<br/>
		And answers to no certain name;<br/>
		How furtively we scan the mist<br/>
		Perchance amid the gloom to find<br/>
		Some moments rare and rapture-kist.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		One Day<br/>
		<br/>
		God-by dear day of sunshine, rain<br/>
		In flooding torrents pours<br/>
		Its liquid footsteps on my roof,<br/>
		Its fingers on my doors.<br/>
		<br/>
		While I sit tranquilly within<br/>
		And tell my beads of joy,<br/>
		Holding a peace within my heart<br/>
		Which nothing can destroy.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Attar<br/>
		<br/>
		Fire---tears---<br/>
		And the torture-chamber,<br/>
		With the last maddening  turn of the screw---<br/>
		Only thus<br/>
		Is one precious drop distilled<br/>
		Of the attar of rose<br/>
		Of the heart.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Youth's Progeny<br/>
		<br/>
		Oh the sad little dreams of the dime yesteryear<br/>
		Lying cold, still and stark in the dust of their bier,<br/>
		How the hear hurries back, all the long weary way,<br/>
		Just to bid them good-night at the close of the day.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I Wnder<br/>
		<br/>
		I wonder---<br/>
		      as I see them pass unheeded down the way,<br/>
		(The women who were once beloved, imperious and gay)<br/>
		Holding with frail, pale hands the cup<br/>
		Of Life's discarded wine<br/>
		If memories<br/>
		Are bliss enough<br/>
		To make the dregs---divine!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Values<br/>
		<br/>
		All the pretty baubles spread<br/>
		Are not the answer to my need,<br/>
		These tinseled trappings but beguile<br/>
		This journeying, while deep within<br/>
		A want unspeakable resides,<br/>
		That throbs and throbs unceasingly,---<br/>
		So hungering,--- no banquet spread<br/>
		Can tempt it, and no golden wine<br/>
		Make it forget: I balance it---<br/>
		The world flies upward in the scale!<br/>
		Always, unsoothed, unquieted,<br/>
		It aches and aches across the days<br/>
		And sears the nights that sum my life.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Armageddon<br/>
		<br/>
		In the silence and the dark<br/>
		I fought with dragons;<br/>
		I was battered, beaten sore<br/>
		But rose again;<br/>
		On my knees I fought still rising<br/>
		In my pain;<br/>
		In the dark I fought with dragons.<br/>
		Weary tears<br/>
		Cease your flowing,<br/>
		Even now, the dawn appears!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Le Soir<br/>
		<br/>
		Mute-lipped---<br/>
		            unquestioning grim-visaged Fate,<br/>
		I cleave the shadows toward the Western Gate;<br/>
		And yet---<br/>
		            my lagging heart still holds<br/>
		Mute-arms outstretched<br/>
		Unto earth's gleaming folds.<br/>
		<br/>
		Who knows?<br/>
		            perhaps Hop'es blossoms spray<br/>
		In lush profusion<br/>
		O'er the edge of day!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Treasure<br/>
		<br/>
		What matters though love's dream shall pass,<br/>
		Since from the throbbing hour-glass<br/>
		One golden-throated moment prest<br/>
		Its attared incense to my breast.<br/>
		<br/>
		Since I have known the purple gleam<br/>
		That lifts above me---can I deem<br/>
		The way unlighted--when I go<br/>
		Encircled by love's afterglow?<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Retrospection<br/>
		<br/>
		After all---<br/>
		             mine is the joy<br/>
		Which naught can lessen or destroy.<br/>
		For love has led my flying feet<br/>
		Where immortelles are springing sweet,<br/>
		And everlasting skies of gold<br/>
		Are memories, when earth is cold<br/>
		And though our future paths should lie<br/>
		Estranged, as star-ways, through the sky,<br/>
		I shall not look reproof, nor find<br/>
		Within this pass a charge unkind,<br/>
		And lightly sorrow shall be met<br/>
		For I can never know regret.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		INTERMEZZI<br/>
		<br/>
		Springtime<br/>
		<br/>
		Again it is the vibrant May,<br/>
		   The bursting buds, the leafing trees,<br/>
		   The fragrant, undulating breeze,<br/>
		   Call to my heart in subtlest way:<br/>
		   Come! come! it is a holiday.<br/>
		<br/>
		The stremlet with unending song,<br/>
		   Beneath its silver veil of mist<br/>
		   Seems flowing, flowing, to some tryst,<br/>
		   While I---with inner surges strong,<br/>
		   Find incomplete the day, and long.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Destiny<br/>
		<br/>
		I know my love is seeing me<br/>
		As restless rivers seek the sea,<br/>
		Across the night, across the days<br/>
		That snare the intervening ways.<br/>
		<br/>
		I know my love is seeking me<br/>
		As Time must seek Eternity,<br/>
		When nights are very still I hear<br/>
		His footsteps, coming, coming near!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Envoys<br/>
		<br/>
		Love calls me tonight<br/>
		In the beat of the rain<br/>
		Through the cold little drops<br/>
		On my bare window-pane;<br/>
		Calls and calls through the dark<br/>
		Like a whispered refrain<br/>
		Tapping soft on my heart<br/>
		Through the bare window pane.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I Want to Die While You Love Me<p>I want to die while you love me,<br/>
		   While yet you hold me fair,<br/>
		While laughter lies upon my lips<br/>
		   And lights are in my hair.<br/>
		 </p><p>I want to die while you love me,<br/>
		   And bear to that still bed,<br/>
		Your kisses turbulent, unspent<br/>
		   To warm me when I’m dead.<br/>
		 </p><p>I want to die while you love me<br/>
		   Oh, who would care to live<br/>
		Till love has nothing more to ask<br/>
		   And nothing more to give?</p><br/>
		<br/>
		Ecstasy<br/>
		<br/>
		Not less than this, beloved,<br/>
		This beaming, highmost ray<br/>
		That sweeps in royal splendor<br/>
		Across our perfect day.<br/>
		<br/>
		Not less than this,---far rather<br/>
		That we should say 'adieu,'<br/>
		With every rose in Eden<br/>
		Abloom for me and you.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Pledge<br/>
		<br/>
		With kisses I'll awake you love<br/>
		So tenderly at morn,<br/>
		The pledges of my fealty<br/>
		Diunally reborn.<br/>
		<br/>
		We'll thread life's way together love,<br/>
		And when the fading light<br/>
		Dips softly over western hills<br/>
		I'll kiss your eyes good-night.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Your Eyes<br/>
		<br/>
		Your eyes---<br/>
		Dark pools, so calm and deep,<br/>
		A thousand ages in them sleep,<br/>
		A dreaming world within them lies,<br/>
		And all my hopes<br/>
		Of paradise!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Amour<br/>
		<br/>
		Kis me!<br/>
		And let the hours bloom triumphantly<br/>
		Before life's little sun has set<br/>
		And I am old.<br/>
		<br/>
		Love me!<br/>
		The day is fleet<br/>
		And I . . . .<br/>
		Am far too passionate<br/>
		To die!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Finality<br/>
		<br/>
		When love's triumphant day is done,<br/>
		Go forward! leave me to the night<br/>
		Beneath the coldly staring stars,<br/>
		The waiting winter and its blight.<br/>
		<br/>
		For I would never hold the heart<br/>
		That mutely quivers to be free,<br/>
		Unfurl your restless wings--away!<br/>
		And leave the emptiness to me.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		In Love<br/>
		<br/>
		I lived in Hell the other day<br/>
		Its fires wrapt me angrily,<br/>
		But now their horrors fall and fade<br/>
		Like ghosts that memory has made.<br/>
		<br/>
		I lived in Hell even today,<br/>
		How sift the fierce flames die away---<br/>
		Submerged with kisses, I forget,<br/>
		With tears upon my pillows yet.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Fiction<br/>
		<br/>
		Ah! love!<br/>
		I shall not seek to penetrate<br/>
		Your webbed gauze<br/>
		Nor tease my heart<br/>
		By queries deep,<br/>
		But hold you tenderly;<br/>
		The day is evening,<br/>
		And I must cull my flowers<br/>
		'Ere dark.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Dead Days<br/>
		<br/>
		Dead days of rapture and espair<br/>
		   I would your hours exhume,<br/>
		Renew their wildness once again<br/>
		   Their rigors and perfume.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		PENSEROSO<br/>
		<br/>
		Break, Break My Heart<br/>
		<br/>
		Break, break my heart<br/>
		For love is done,<br/>
		The pale light trails the dying sun---<br/>
		And night awaits--no hope---no stars<br/>
		Darkness<br/>
		Hide my scars!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Little King<br/>
		<br/>
		From worshipping I now arise<br/>
		Stunned and aghast, with opoen eyes<br/>
		I see the real, the little you<br/>
		I thought so gallant, brave and true.<br/>
		<br/>
		A pity yet is mine, I fear,<br/>
		Since wherefore comes this falling tear,<br/>
		For none among your fawning throng<br/>
		Will love you well, nor love you long.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Romance<br/>
		<br/>
		When I was young<br/>
		             I used to say:<br/>
		romance <em>will come</em> risding by<br/>
		And I shall surely smile<br/>
		And play with him awhile.<br/>
		<br/>
		When I grew older<br/>
		             then I said:<br/>
		romance <em>may come</em>riding by<br/>
		I wonder shall I smile<br/>
		And play with him awhile?<br/>
		<br/>
		But now---<br/>
		             Alas! I only say:<br/>
		Romance <i>never will</i> come by<br/>
		And I shall never smile<br/>
		He has been dead the while!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Falling Gods<br/>
		<br/>
		Confusion, desuetude and gloom,<br/>
		   The travailing of sound,<br/>
		Fell desolation in my soul,<br/>
		   And agony profound;<br/>
		The gods are falling heavily<br/>
		   And for all time to be,<br/>
		And never more my heart shall know<br/>
		   A shrine to Deity!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Armour<br/>
		<br/>
		You cannot hurt me any more<br/>
		   For I am armored now<br/>
		And I can look into your face<br/>
		   With cool, unfevered brow.<br/>
		<br/>
		The tranquil river meets the sea,<br/>
		   My life flows on at rest,<br/>
		Unurged, untorn, but oh, my God!<br/>
		   I love the old way best!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Divide<br/>
		<br/>
		Your lightes breath may fan my cheek<br/>
		Your whisper stir me when you speak,<br/>
		And yet---<br/>
		The teeming planets play<br/>
		Between your heart---and mine<br/>
		Today.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Return<br/>
		<br/>
		Now,<br/>
		Like the pines intoning<br/>
		Though some solitary gloom<br/>
		My errant throughts go pattering<br/>
		About love's ancient tomb,<br/>
		And though no breath of incense rare<br/>
		Lies round the shattered cup,<br/>
		A banquet weird, the fragments<br/>
		Where the ghost of love<br/>
		May sup.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Song of the Sinner<br/>
		<br/>
		Just a bit of ashes<br/>
		Grey, grey ashes---spent---<br/>
		God! how fierce the fires burned<br/>
		Down to this continent.<br/>
		<br/>
		Just a bit of ashes,<br/>
		Not a single spark<br/>
		Lives in this residuum<br/>
		Crumbling cold and dark.<br/>
		<br/>
		Just a bit of ashes---<br/>
		To the judgment day,<br/>
		I go with my memories---<br/>
		Pray, sweet virgin, pray!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Celibacy<br/>
		<br/>
		Where is the love that might have been<br/>
		flung to the far ends of Earth?<br/>
		In my body stamping around,<br/>
		In my body like a hound<br/>
		Leashed and restless---<br/>
		Biding time!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		CADENCE<br/>
		<br/>
		Offering<br/>
		<br/>
		I seek no tokens of you dear<br/>
		   I only ask to give<br/>
		The purple flower of my heart<br/>
		   And you will let it live.<br/>
		<br/>
		I ask no fealty or plight,<br/>
		   I only pray that you<br/>
		May find earth's barren places bright<br/>
		   Perhaps, because it grew.<br/>
		<br/>
		And when for you the final sun<br/>
		   Moves toward the darkening West,<br/>
		I shall be lingering to place<br/>
		   Love's flower on your breast.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Estrangement<br/>
		<br/>
		Some day I shall be dead, and pride<br/>
		   Which kept me from your feet,<br/>
		Shall be the burden of the song<br/>
		   My cold lips shall repeat.<br/>
		<br/>
		And some day when you too shall find<br/>
		   A pillow in the sod,<br/>
		Would you then spurn an hour with me<br/>
		   Above---where daisies nod?<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Recessional<br/>
		<br/>
		Consider me a memory---a dream<br/>
		That passed away,<br/>
		Or yet, a flower that has blown and shattered---<br/>
		In a day;<br/>
		For passion sleeps, alas, and keeps no vigil<br/>
		With the years,<br/>
		And wakens to no conjuring<br/>
		Of orison or tears.<br/>
		<br/>
		Consider me a melody<br/>
		That served its simple turn,<br/>
		Or but the residue of fire<br/>
		That settles in the urn,<br/>
		For love defies puring reasoning<br/>
		And undeterred flows<br/>
		Within---without<br/>
		The vassal heart!<br/>
		Its reasoning---<br/>
		Who knows?<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Sepulchre<br/>
		<br/>
		I have mounded the corpse of my sorrow<br/>
		   And wreathed it with roses fair<br/>
		That none who may pass on the morrow<br/>
		   May know what lies buried there.<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Curtain<br/>
		<br/>
		When one has lived<br/>
		'Tis not so hard<br/>
		To fold the hands,<br/>
		To say, "Good-night,"<br/>
		and creep away<br/>
		Behind the dark:<br/>
		But 'tis not strange<br/>
		The heart rebels<br/>
		When sounds of night<br/>
		Ring down the day<br/>
		That was a weary, joyless way<br/>
		From early dawn<br/>
		To setting sun:<br/>
		How eagerly we trail the light<br/>
		For crumbs of happiness we fend,<br/>
		And struggle, struggle---to the end!<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Afterglow<br/>
		<br/>
		Through you I entered heaven and hell,<br/>
		Knew rapture and despair,<br/>
		I flitted o'er the plains of earth<br/>
		And scaled each shining stair:<br/>
		Drank deep the waters of content,<br/>
		And drained the cup of gall,<br/>
		Was regal and was impotent,<br/>
		Was suzerain and thrall.<br/>
		<br/>
		Now, by Reflection's placide pool<br/>
		On evening's mellowed brow,<br/>
		I smile across the backward way<br/>
		And pledge anew my vow;<br/>
		For every glancing, golden gleam,<br/>
		I offer gladly---pain!<br/>
		And I would give a thousand world<br/>
		To live it all again!<br/>

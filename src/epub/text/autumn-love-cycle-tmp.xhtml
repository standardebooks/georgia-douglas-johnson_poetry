			<p>
v#I closed my shutters fast last night,
v#Reluctantly and slow,
v#So pleading was the purple sky
v#With all the lights hung low;
v#I left my lagging heart outside
v#Within the dark alone,
v#I heard it singing through the gloom
v#A wordless, anguished tone.
v#Upon my sleepless couch I lay
v#Until the tranquil morn
v#Came through the silver silences
v#To bring my heart forlorn,
v#Restoring it with calm caress
v#Unto its sheltered bower,
v#While whispering: “Await, await
v#Your golden, perfect hour.”

v#But down the winding road they wend
v#To some other journey’s end.

v#Yet,—I would not have them wait
v#Here within my guarded gate,
v#Certain footsteps I shall know,
v#And for them I listen low!

v#Surround me,—fetter and consume.

v#Your lightest breath may fan my cheek
v#Your whisper stir me when you speak,
v#And yet—
v#The teeming planets play
v#Between your heart—and mine
v#Today.

v#Now,
v#Like the pines intoning
v#Though some solitary gloom,
v#My errant throughts go pattering
v#About love's ancient tomb,
v#And though no breath of incense rare
v#Lies round the shattered cup,
v#A banquet weird, the fragments
v#Where the ghost of love
v#May sup.

v#Just a bit of ashes
v#Grey, grey ashes—spent—
v#God! how fierce the fires burned
v#Down to this continent.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Just a bit of ashes,
v#Not a single spark
v#Lives in this residuum
v#Crumbling cold and dark.
</p>
<p>
v#Just a bit of ashes—
v#To the judgment day,
v#I go with my memories—
v#Pray, sweet virgin, pray!

v#I seek no tokens of you dear

v#The purple flower of my heart
v##And you will let it live.

v#I ask no fealty or plight,
v##I only pray that you
v#May find earth's barren places bright
v##Perhaps, because it grew.

v#And when for you the final sun
v##Moves toward the darkening West,
v#I shall be lingering to place
v##Love's flower on your breast.

v##A pillow in the sod,

v#Consider me a memory—a dream
v#That passed away,
v#Or yet, a flower that has blown and shattered—
v#In a day;
v#For passion sleeps, alas, and keeps no vigil
v#With the years,
v#And wakens to no conjuring
v#Of orison or tears.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Consider me a melody
v#That served its simple turn,
v#Or but the residue of fire
v#That settles in the urn,
v#For love defies pure reasoning
v#And undeterred flows
v#Within—without
v#The vassal heart!
v#Its reasoning—
v#Who knows?

v#When one has lived
v#'Tis not so hard
v#To fold the hands,
v#To say, "Good-night,"
v#And creep away
v#Behind the dark;
v#But 'tis not strange
v#The heart rebels
v#When sounds of night
v#Ring down the day
v#That was a weary, joyless way
v#From early dawn
v#To setting sun:
v#How eagerly we trail the light
v#For crumbs of happiness we fend,
v#And struggle, struggle—to the end!

v#Through you I entered heaven and hell,
v#Knew rapture and despair,
v#I flitted o'er the plains of earth
v#And scaled each shining stair:
v#Drank deep the waters of content,
v#And drained the cup of gall,
v#Was regal and was impotent,
v#Was suzerain and thrall.
</p>
<p>
v#Now, by Reflection's placid pool
v#On evening's mellowed brow,
v#I smile across the backward way
v#And pledge anew my vow;
v#For every glancing, golden gleam,
v#I offer gladly—pain!
v#And I would give a thousand world
v#To live it all again!
